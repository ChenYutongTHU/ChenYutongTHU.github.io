Hi, I'm Yutong Chen (陈语童).I'm a second-year doctorate student in the [Computer Vision and Learning Group](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) supervised by [Prof. Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Siyu-Tang.html) and [Prof. Marc Pollefeys](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/marc.pollefeys/). Prior to this, I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

In terms of [my research](https://chenyutongthu.github.io/publication/), I am passionate about developing intelligent visual systems that can perceive and interact with the 3D world. Specifically, my research focuses on recovering 3D structures from minimal input data by combining geometric principles with data-driven techniques.

I dream of being a chef, sharing love and warmth through home-cooked meals. [Here](https://chenyutongthu.github.io/kitchen/) are some of my daily creations, mostly baked goods, as I have a serious sweet tooth! :)

My favorite people and inspirations: [Mao Shimada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9lirJRpHEo&pp=ygULbWFvIHNoaWFtZGE%3D), Rafael Nadal, [Laufey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChpKl3waLmccNeYH9LGYjUQ), and Frédéric Chopin.
