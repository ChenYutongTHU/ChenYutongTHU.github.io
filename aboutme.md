My name is Yutong Chen. I am a 2nd year doctorate student at [Computer Vision and Learning Group](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/) in [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) supervised by [Prof. Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Siyu-Tang.html) and [Prof. Marc Pollefeys](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/marc.pollefeys/). Before this, I obtained my Bachelor and Master degrees in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).


### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
