My name is Yutong Chen, and I'm a second-year doctorate student in the [Computer Vision and Learning Group](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) supervised by [Prof. Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Siyu-Tang.html) and [Prof. Marc Pollefeys](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/marc.pollefeys/). Prior to this, I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

I'm passionate about building visual intelligent systems that can perceive and interact with the 3D world. My doctoral research focuses on fundamental challenges in creating 3D digital worlds, including improving 3D and 4D representations and developing scalable methods for 3D data acquisition and generation. I'm now particularly interested in recovering 3D underlying structures from minimal input captures, by combining geometric insights with data-driven approaches.

Outside of computer vision research, I dream of being a chef—sharing love and warmth through my home-cooked meals. Below are some of my daily creations, mostly baked goods, since I have a serious sweet tooth :)

My favorite people and inspirations: [Mao Shimada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9lirJRpHEo&pp=ygULbWFvIHNoaWFtZGE%3D), Rafael Nadal, and Frédéric Chopin.
